Delta AG DEX is a decentralized user interface that operates on the 1inch Aggregator. It functions by breaking down sizable orders into numerous smaller ones, subsequently executing them on various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to guarantee optimal pricing. The platform employs an algorithm named Pathfinder, which locates the most effective paths for trade execution while considering each exchange's gas fees and liquidity.
